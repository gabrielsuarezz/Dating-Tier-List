# Image Directory

This folder is for storing local images for your date cards.

## How to Add Images

1. Take photos when you visit each location (or download from their official websites)
2. Save them in this folder with the naming convention: `{date-id}.jpg`
3. The app will automatically load them

## Naming Convention

Match the `id` field from your date objects:

- `vizcaya.jpg` → Vizcaya Museum
- `butterfly.jpg` → Butterfly World
- `silverball.jpg` → Silverball Arcade
- `ygm.jpg` → Yellow Green Market
- etc.

## Recommended Image Specs

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Size**: 800px wide (will be automatically resized)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or 4:3 works best
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for fast loading

## Placeholder

Until you add your own images, the app will use fallback images based on the category (art, history, fun, food).
